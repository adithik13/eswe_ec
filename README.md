Hello! This is a brief but effective implementation of a transaction software.

This is written in python, and requires a separate testing file to run the code.

Functionality is demonstrated through tests. 

To run this code, make sure that the testing.py and transaction.py files are in the same directory, and then simply run the testing.py script. The correct output should be : 

None
No active transaction.
None
6
No active transaction to commit.
No active transaction to rollback.
None
None

Edits can be made to the values in the script to see how the code responds.

Assignment improvements: 

I think that this assignment is effective as is, but maybe it would be improved as a 
"real assignment" by making us write a few structured test cases and run a test suite.

Alternatively, this could be a good demo of the Google Test testing suite. 

This seems clear enough as is, but I think using it as a basis for how to construct and
run testing locally could be useful.
